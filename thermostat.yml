# Recipe for thermostat1 collection
#
# Note that protobuf-java is a BR of netty, its source RPM may be obtain here:
#
# https://www.softwarecollections.org/repos/rhscl/thermostat1/epel-7-x86_64/thermostat1-protobuf-java-2.5.0-5.el7.centos.src.rpm
#
# Instructions as to how to build the collection are:
#
# 1. Install dependent scldevel packages + javapackages-tools:
#    $ yum install rh-mongodb26-scldevel \
#                  rh-java-common-scldevel \
#                  maven30-scldevel \
#                  maven30-javapackages-tools
# 2. Build metapackage: thermostat1
# 3. Build other packages as listed in this yaml file.
#
# The maven30 dependency is build-only. No runtime requires should
# get generated on maven30 packages.
